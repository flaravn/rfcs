# Contributing
RFC or Request For Comments are a way to present an idea to other people when collaborating on community-run projects, like Project Flara! 
They're like specific instructions to an artist that you commision so that their end result will be like what you expect!

For tech-savvy contributors, the process should be straight-forward. But here are instructions for those that aren't!
Pretty much, all the RFCs are stored in this "repository", pretty much a shared "Google Drive" but with better collaboration tools!

1. Create an account on GitHub.
2. Go back to this repository and click the fork button:

3. Voila! A fork repository can be found 
4. Copy and paste the contents of [0000-new-story-plot.md] file to the [stories](stories) folder. That's more likely what you are looking for if you're looking to introduce a new story plot.
5. Edit the template so that they are all filled in.
6. Commit the changes and don't forget to write a meaningful message stating what you have done with the changes.
7. After completing your changes, create a new pull request!
8. Other people will review your RFC and give feedback to you before the story is accepted in.
9. When the story is accepted in, the pull request will be "merged" into this repository and a new issue will be created to indicate that the story needs to be implemented into the game.
10. Once the story is implemented (the dialogs are all coded into the development code), the issue will be closed and just wait for the release!
